# How to optimise the OS

In this section there is a guide on how to download and optimise the RaspberryPi OS for use with GeomorphPi. Through a combination of code optimisation and operating system (OS) selection, the end goal is to achieve the fastest boot time.




## Step 1 - Downloading the OS

A RaspberryPi can boot into a number of OS, based upon the Debian OS. For GeomorphPi we chose the RaspberryPi OS Lite (available [Here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)).

To install the OS onto your SD card you will need to format and then transfer the OS to the card. To format the SD card first download a SD card formatiing software (available [Here](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/)) and format the SD card. **Warning this will erase all data on the SD card**
